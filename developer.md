Perma - developer notes
========================

This document contains tips and tricks for working with Perma.

See the [installation documentation](./install.md) to get up and running.


Common tasks and commands
-------------------------

These commands assume you have configured your shell with the alias defined in
the [shortcuts](./install.md#shortcuts) section of the installation docs, and that
Perma's Docker containers are up and running in the background:
-  run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers
-  run `docker-compose down` to stop them when you are finished.

(If you are not running Perma inside Docker, most of the below the commands
should still work: just skip the `d`!)

### Run Perma

`d fab run`

That's it! You should now be able to load Perma in your browser at
`http://perma.kresnanusantara.co.id:80/`. It will take a few seconds for the first page
to load, while we wait for Perma's CSS, JS and other assets to be compiled.

To log in and explore Perma, try logging in as one of our
[test users](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma/blob/develop/perma_web/fixtures/users.json). All test users have a password of "pass".

The server will automatically reload any time you made a change to the
`perma_web` directory: just refresh the page to see your changes.

Press `CONTROL-C` to stop the server.

To run with SSL (for instance, to test locally against a remote
instance of webrecorder that is behind SSL), set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT
= True`, try

`d fab run:use_ssl=True`

and visit `https://perma.kresnanusantara.co.id:80/` -- you'll need to make an
exception for the self-signed certificate in your
browser. Alternatively, you can supply your own certificate with
something like

`d fab run:use_ssl=True,cert_file=myfile.crt`

(See `run_django` in `perma_web/fabfile/dev.py` for how the
self-signed certificate is created.)

Remember to set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False` when you go back to
running without SSL. Note also that if you run with SSL against a
local (non-SSL) webrecorder, playback will fail silently.

### Run all the tests

`d fab test`

See [Testing and Test Coverage](#testing-and-test-coverage) for more
information about testing Perma.

### Run a particular test (python only)

Python tests are run via pytest. Pytest supports several ways to
[select and run tests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#specifying-tests-selecting-tests),
including a super-convenient keyword-matching option:

`d pytest -k "name_of_a_test_that_failed"`

`d pytest -k "a_specific_test_module"`

See [Testing and Test Coverage](#testing-and-test-coverage) for more
information about testing Perma.

### Update the python dependencies

Make your changes in `Pipfile`. Then run `update.sh`, a convenience
script that will create a new `Pipfile.lock` and will rebuild the
Docker image with the new dependencies installed.

N.B. To ensure that other Perma developers are prompted to install
your changes, please increment the image version number for "web"
in `docker-compose.yaml`. This is not yet managed programmatically.

### Update the node dependencies

Make your changes in `packages.json`. Then run `update.sh`, a convenience
script that will create a new `npm-shrinkwrap.json` and will rebuild the
Docker image with the new dependencies installed.

N.B. To ensure that other Perma developers are prompted to install
you changes, please increment the image version number for "web"
in `docker-compose.yaml`. This is not yet managed programmatically.

### Migrate the database

`d ./manage.py makemigrations`

`d ./manage.py migrate`

`d ./manage.py migrate --database=perma-cdxline`

For more information on migrations, see [Schema and data migrations](#schema-and-data-migrations)

### Reset the database

1) `docker-compose down` to delete your existing containers.
2) `docker volume rm perma_db3_data` to delete the database.
3) `docker-compose up -d` to spin up new containers.
4) `bash init_perma.sh` to create a fresh database, pre-populated with test fixtures.

### Run arbitrary commands

You can run `d bash` to get a bash terminal in your container. Your python
environment will be activated and you will be logged in as root.

You can also prefix arbitrary commands with `d`:
-  `d which python` (output: the virtualenv's python)
-  `d ls` (output: /perma/perma_web)


## Git and GitHub

We use git to track code changes and use [GitHub](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma) to host the code publicly.

The Master branch always contains production code (probably the thing currently running at [Perma.cc](http://perma.cc)) while the develop branch contains the group's working version. We follow [Vincent Driessen's approach](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Fork our repo, then make a feature branch on your fork. Issue a pull request to merge your feature branch into harvard-lil's develop branch when your code is ready.

Track issues using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma/issues).

## Optional developer packages

You can install some handy developer packages with `d pip install -r dev_requirements.txt`:

* `ipdb` is a nice drop-in replacement for `pdb`.
* `django-extensions` adds [a bunch of useful manage.py commands](http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command_extensions.html).
  Particularly useful are `runserver_plus` and `shell_plus`. If installed, this will be automatically enabled by `settings_dev.py`,
  and`fab run` will use `runserver_plus` instead of `runserver`.
* `django-debug-toolbar` includes a handy debug toolbar in frontend pages. If installed, this will be automatically enabled by `settings_dev.py`.

`django-extensions` and `django-debug-toolbar` can both cause confusing errors occasionally, so try disabling them
if you run into something odd.


## Logs

All of your logs will end up in `./services/logs`. As a convenience, you can tail -f all of them with `d fab dev.logs`.


## Code style and techniques

### User roles and permissions tests

We have several types of users:

* Logged in users are identified the standard Django way: `user.is_authenticated`
* Users may belong to organizations. You should test this with `user.is_organization_user`.
* Users may belong to a registrar (`user.registrar is not None`). You should test this with `user.is_registrar_member()`.
* Admin users are identified the standard Django way: `user.is_staff`

Users that belong to organizations can belong to many, including organizations belonging to multiple registrars. Users who belong to a registrar may only belong to a single registrar. Users should not simultaneously belong to both organizations and to a registrar.


### Javascript templates

Use [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) when injecting markup using JavaScript.

Our templates are pre-compiled by webpack. The source files are in `perma_web > static > js > hbs`


### Sending email

*All emails* should be sent using `perma.email.send_user_email` (for an email from us to a user) or
`perma.utils.send_admin_email` (for an email "from" a user to us). This makes sure that `from` and `reply-to` fields
are configured so our MTA will actually transmit the email.

On the development server, emails are dumped to the standard out courtesy of EMAIL_BACKEND in settings_dev.py.

### Asset pipeline

Front-end assets are processed and packaged by Webpack. Assets can be compiled with this command:

    docker-compose exec web ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js --watch

This is automatically run in the background by `d fab run`, so there is usually no need to run it manually.

Compiled bundles generated by Webpack should be committed to the git repository along with the
source code changes that produced them.

### Managing static files and user-generated files

We use Django's built-in functions to manage static assets (Javascript/CSS/etc.) and user-generated media (our link archives).

To make sure everything works smoothly in various environments (local dev, Linux servers, and cloud services),
be sure to use the following settings when referring to disk locations and URLs in your code and templates:

* STATIC_ROOT: Absolute path to static assets (e.g. '/tmp/perma/static/')
* STATIC_URL: URL to retrieve static assets (e.g. '/static/')
* MEDIA_ROOT: Absolute path to user-generated assets (e.g. '/tmp/perma/generated/')
* MEDIA_URL: URL to retrieve user-generated assets (e.g. '/media/')

The \_ROOT settings may have different meanings depending on the storage backend. For example,
if DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE is set to use the Amazon S3 storage backend,
then MEDIA_ROOT would just be '/generated/' and would be relative to the root of the S3 bucket.

In templates, use the `{% static %}` tag and MEDIA_URL:

    {% load static %}
    <img src="{% static "img/header_image.jpg" %}">
    <img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}{{ asset.image_capture }}">

Using the `{% static %}` tag instead of `{{ STATIC_URL }}` ensures that cache-busting and
pre-compressed versions of the files will be served on production.

In code, use Django's default_storage to read and write user-generated files rather than accessing the filesystem directly:

    from django.core.files.storage import default_storage

    with default_storage.open('some/path', 'rb') as image_file:
        do_stuff_with_image_file(image_file)

Paths for default_storage are relative to MEDIA_ROOT.

* [Django docs for serving static files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/)

### Hosting fonts locally

We like to host our fonts locally. If you're linking a font from Google fonts and the licensing allows, check out [fontdump](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fontdump/1.2.0)


##  Schema and data migrations

*** Before changing the schema or the data of your production database, make a backup! ***

If you make a change to the Django model (models get mapped directly to relational database tables), you'll need to create a [migration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/). Migrations come in two flavors: schema migrations and data migrations.


### Schema migrations and data migrations

Schema migrations are used when changing the model structure (adding, removing, editing fields) and data migrations are used when you need to ferry data between your schema changes (you renamed a field and need to move data from the old field name to the new field name).

The most straight forward data migration might be the addition of a new model or the addition of a field to a model. When you perform a straight forward change to the model, your command might look like this

    $ d ./manage.py makemigrations

This will create a migration file for you on disk, something like,

    $ cat perma_web/perma/migrations/0003_auto__add_org__add_field_linkuser_org.py

Even though you've changed your models file and created a migration (just a python file on disk), your database remains unchanged. You'll need to apply the migration to update your database,

    $ d manage.py migrate
    $ d manage.py migrate --database=perma-cdxline

Now, your database, your model, and your migration should all be at the same point. You can list your migrations using the list command,

    $ d manage.py migrate --list

Data migrations follow the same flow, but add a step in the middle. See the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#data-migrations) for details on how to perform a data migration.


### Track migrations in Git and get started

You should commit your migrations to your repository and push to GitHub.

    $ git add perma_web/perma/migrations/0003_auto__add_org__add_field_linkuser_org.py
    $ git commit -m "Added migration"


## Testing and Test Coverage

Python unit tests live in `perma/tests`, `api/tests`, etc.

Functional tests live in `functional_tests/`.

Javascript tests live in `spec/`.

See the [Common tasks and commands](#common-tasks-and-commands) for the
common techniques for running the tests.

The `d fab test` command also generates handy coverage information. You can access it by running `d coverage`.


### Linting with flake8

All code must show zero warnings or errors when running `flake8 .` in `perma_web/`.

Flake8 settings are configured in `perma_web/.pep8`

If you want to automatically run flake8 before pushing your code, you can add something like this to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` or `.git/hooks/pre-push`:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    docker-compose exec -T web pipenv run flake8 .
    exit $?

Be sure to mark the hook as executable: `chmod u+x .git/hooks/pre-commit` or `chmod u+x .git/hooks/pre-push`.

(You have to have started the containers with `docker-compose up -d` for this to work.)

### Sauce Browser Tests

We also use Sauce Labs to do functional testing of the site in common browsers before deploying. If you have a Sauce account,
you can set SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY in settings.py, and then run our Sauce tests with

    $ d fab dev.test_sauce

By default `d fab dev.test_sauce` is pointed at 127.0.0.1:80, which Sauce can't reach from outside, so you'll have to set
up a tunnel first by running

    $ d fab dev.sauce_tunnel

in the background or in another terminal window.

The Sauce tests live in `./services/sauce/run_tests.py`. If you are developing new tests in that file, it may be more
convenient to change to that directory and run `d python run_tests.py`, rather than the full-blown parallel testing
kicked off by `d fab dev.test_sauce`.


## Working with Celery

Celery does two things in Perma.cc: it runs the capture tasks and it runs scheduled jobs (to gather things nightly like statistics, just like cron might).

In development, it's sometimes easier to run everything synchronously, without the additional layer of complexity a Celery worker adds. To run synchronously, set `RUN_TASKS_ASYNC = False` in settings.py. `RUN_TASKS_ASYNC` must be true if you are specifically testing or setting up a new a Celery-Django interaction, and must be true when working with LinkBatches (otherwise subtle bugs may not surface).

In your development environment (if you are not using Docker, where the celery service should be running by default), you probably want to start a dev version of Celery like this:

    $ celery -A perma worker --loglevel=info -B

The -B option also starts the Beat server. The Beat server is the thing that runs the scheduled jobs. You don't need the -B if you don't want to run the nightly scheduled jobs.

If you make changes to a Perma.cc Celery task, you'll need to stop and start the Celery server. This is true even when the Django development server restarts by itself.

If you want to run Celery as a daemon (like you might in prod), there is an example upstart script in services/celery/celery.conf.
This is the script that is used to run the daemon for Vagrant.

Once installed in /etc/init/, you can start and stop Celery as a service. Something like,

    $ sudo stop celery; sudo start celery

Find more about daemonizing Celery in the [in the Celery docs](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/daemonizing.html#daemonizing).


## Working with Redis

In our production environment we use Redis as a cache for our thumbnail data and to
speed up the playback of web archives. If you want to simulate the production
environment:
-  find the "redis" stanza of `docker-compose.yml`, currently commented out, and comment in it
-  find the "volumes" stanza of `docker-compose.yml` and comment in `redis_data`
-  add the caches setting found in `settings_prod.py` to your `settings.py`


## Running with DEBUG=False locally

If you are running Perma locally for development using the default settings_dev.py, [DEBUG](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#std:setting-DEBUG) is set to true. This is in general a big help, because Django displays a detailed error page any time your code raises an exception. However, it makes it impossible to test your app's error handing, see your custom 404 or 500 pages, etc.

To run with DEBUG=False locally, first stop the webserver, if it's running. Add ```DEBUG=False``` to settings.py or (to alter settings\_dev.py). Then, run ``` d ./manage.py collectstatic```, which creates ```./services/django/static_assets``` (necessary for the css and other static assets to be served properly). Then, run ```d fab run``` as usual to start the web server.

__NB__: With DEBUG=False, the server will not automatically restart each time you save changes.

__NB__: If you make changes to static files, like css, while running with DEBUG=False, you must rerun  ``` d manage.py collectstatic``` and restart the server to see your changes.

## Perma Payments

Aspects of Perma's paid subscription service are handled by the companion application, [Perma Payments](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma-payments).

By default, Perma's `docker-compose` file will spin up a local Perma Payments for you to experiment with. For more fruitful experimentation, configure this Perma Payments to interact with Cybersource's test tier, by running Payments with a custom settings.py that contains our credentials. See `docker-compose.yml` and `/services/docker/perma-payments/settings.py.example` for more information. CyberSource will not be able to communicate its responses back to your local instance, of course, but you can simulate active subscriptions using the Django admin.


## Internet Archive

For extra backup, we use Internet Archive for Perma archive storage.
Here is an [example archive](https://archive.org/details/perma_cc_8XUF-4UEQ).

It is important to note that we only store public archives on IA.

Links that are made private after they have been uploaded to Internet Archive are immediately removed from the site (this means that the WARC file no longer exists in IA, and all Perma-generated metadata, except for the identifier, gets removed. There are a few auto-generated fields that IA does not allow the deletion of, like Lastfiledate and Scandate).

A [Celery](#working-with-celery) background task is responsible for running nightly uploads of 24-48 hour old public links, and uploading them to Internet Archive.


IA-related methods (like `upload_all_to_internet_archive` and `delete_from_internet_archive`) live in [tasks.py](perma_web/perma/tasks.py).

In order to run these tasks, you will need to specify some keys in your settings.py:

- INTERNET_ARCHIVE_COLLECTION (The name of the collection you want to upload to. `test_collection` is good for testing, as it gets deleted every so often by IA).
- UPLOAD_TO_INTERNET_ARCHIVE (True or False, whether to allow uploading)
- INTERNET_ARCHIVE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX (In our case, our prefix is perma_cc_ so that our archives are accessible through a URL like this: https://archive.org/detail/perma_cc_GUID)
- INTERNET_ARCHIVE_ACCESS_KEY [click here to retrieve](https://archive.org/account/s3.php)
- INTERNET_ARCHIVE_SECRET_KEY [click here to retrieve](https://archive.org/account/s3.php)
