Perma - developer notes
=====

This document does not cover installing Perma.cc. You should use the install doc for that.

There are a bunch of moving pieces in Perma.cc. This document provides some notes on common dances you might have to perform.


## Git and GitHub

We use git to track code changes and use [GitHub](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma) to host the code publicly.

The Master branch always contains production code (probably the thing currently running at [Perma.cc](http://perma.cc)) while the develop branch contains the group's working version. We follow this [Vincent Driessen's approach](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Leverage [feature branches](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) in your local development flow. Merge your code back into the develop branch and push to GitHub often. Small, quick commits avoid nightmare merge problems.


## Optional developer packages

You can install some handy developer packages with `pip install -r dev_requirements.txt`:

* `ipdb` is a nice drop-in replacement for `pdb`.
* `django-extensions` adds [a bunch of useful manage.py commands](http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command_extensions.html). 
  Particularly useful are `runserver_plus` and `shell_plus`. If installed, this will be automatically enabled by `settings_dev.py`,
  and`fab run` will use `runserver_plus` instead of `runserver`.
* `django-debug-toolbar` includes a handy debug toolbar in frontend pages. If installed, this will be automatically enabled by `settings_dev.py`.

`django-extensions` and `django-debug-toolbar` can both cause confusing errors occasionally, so try disabling them
if you run into something odd.

## Logs

If you are using Vagrant, all of your logs will end up in /vagrant/services/logs. As a convenience, you can tail -f all of them with `fab logs`.


## Code style and techniques

### User roles and permissions tests

We have several types of users:

* Logged in users are identified the standard Django way: `user.is_authenticated`
* Users may belong to a vesting org (`user.vesting_org is not None`). You should test this with `user.is_vesting_org_member()`, which avoids an extra database call and can be easily updated in case the underlying data model changes.
* Users may belong to a registrar (`user.registrar is not None`). You should test this with `user.is_registrar_member()`. 
* Admin users are identified the standard Django way: `user.is_staff`

Currently a user can be either a member of a single vesting org or a single registrar. In the future we may allow multiple relationships.

### Managing static files and user-generated files

We use Django's built-in functions to manage static assets (Javascript/CSS/etc.) and user-generated media (our link archives).

To make sure everything works smoothly in various environments (local dev, Linux servers, and cloud services),
be sure to use the following settings when referring to disk locations and URLs in your code and templates:

* STATIC_ROOT: Absolute path to static assets (e.g. '/tmp/perma/static/')
* STATIC_URL: URL to retrieve static assets (e.g. '/static/')
* MEDIA_ROOT: Absolute path to user-generated assets (e.g. '/tmp/perma/generated/')
* MEDIA_URL: URL to retrieve user-generated assets (e.g. '/media/')

The \_ROOT settings may have different meanings depending on the storage backend. For example,
if DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE is set to use the Amazon S3 storage backend,
then MEDIA_ROOT would just be '/generated/' and would be relative to the root of the S3 bucket.

In templates, use STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL:

    <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/header_image.jpg">

    <img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}{{ asset.image_capture }}">

In code, use Django's default_storage to read and write user-generated files rather than accessing the filesystem directly:

    from django.core.files.storage import default_storage

    with default_storage.open('some/path', 'rb') as image_file:
        do_stuff_with_image_file(image_file)

Paths for default_storage are relative to MEDIA_ROOT.

* [Django docs for serving static files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/)


## Hosting fonts locally

We like to host our fonts locally. If you're liking a font from Google fonts and the licesning allows, check out[fontdump](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fontdump/1.2.0)


##  Schema and data migrations

*** Before changing the schema or the data of your database, make a backup! ***

If you make a change to the Django model (models get mapped directly to relational database tables), you'll need to create a [migration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/). Migrations come in two flavors: schema migrations and data migrations.


### Schema migrations and data migrations

Schema migrations are used when changing the model structure (adding, removing, editing fields) and data migrations are used when you need to ferry data between your schema changes (you renamed a field and need to move data from the old field name to the new field name).

The most straight forward data migration might be the addition of a new model or the addition of a field to a model. When you perform a straight forward change to the model, your command might look like this

    $ ./manage.py makemigrations

This will create a migration file for you on disk, something like,

    $ cat perma_web/perma/migrations/0003_auto__add_vestingorg__add_field_linkuser_vesting_org.py

Even though you've changed your models file and created a migration (just a python file on disk), your database remains unchanged. You'll need to apply the migration to update your database,

    $ ./manage.py migrate

Now, your database, your model, and your migration should all be at the same point. You can list your migrations using the list command,

    $ ./manage.py migrate --list

Data migrations follow the same flow, but add a step in the middle. See the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#data-migrations) for details on how to perform a data migration.


### Track migrations in Git and get started

You should commit your migrations to your repository and push to GitHub.

    $ git add perma_web/perma/migrations/0003_auto__add_vestingorg__add_field_linkuser_vesting_org.py
    $ git commit -m "Added migration"


## Testing and Test Coverage

If you add or change a feature, be sure to add a test for it in perma/tests/. Tests are run like this:

    $ fab test

You should always run the tests before committing code.

The `fab test` command also generates handy coverage information. You can access it with the `coverage` command.


### Sauce Browser Tests

We also use Sauce Labs to do functional testing of the site in common browsers before deploying. If you have a Sauce account,
you can set SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY in settings.py, and then run our Sauce tests with
 
    $ fab test_sauce
    
By default `fab test_sauce` is pointed at 127.0.0.1:8000, which Sauce can't reach from outside, so you'll have to set
up a tunnel first by running

    $ fab sauce_tunnel
    
in the background or in another terminal window.

The Sauce tests live in services/sauce/run_tests.py. If you are developing new tests in that file, it may be more
convenient to change to that directory and run `python run_tests.py`, rather than the full-blown parallel testing
kicked off by `fab test_sauce`.


## Debugging email-related issues

If you're working on an email related task, the contents of emails should be dumped to the standard out courtesy of EMAIL_BACKEND in settings_dev.py.


## Mirroring

Perma uses a mirroring system in which one server handles logged-in users and content creation, and a set of mirrors help to serve archived content.
A load balancer routes traffic between them. The net effect is that http://dashboard.perma.cc is served by one server,
while http://perma.cc may be served by any randomly selected mirror.

For development, we simulate Perma's network by running a simple load balancer on the local machine at \*.perma.dev:8000.
The load balancer routes requests to dashboard.perma.dev:8000 to the main Django dev server running on port :8001,
and requests to perma.dev:8000 to a mirror Django dev server running on port :8002.

To set that up, first edit your hosts file (/etc/hosts or \system32\drivers\etc\hosts) to add the following line:

    127.0.0.1    *.perma.dev

(If you're using Vagrant, this should happen on your host machine. The rest happens in the guest machine.)

Install Twisted:

    pip install twisted
    
Launch the simple load balancer and two Django dev servers:

    python manage.py runmirror

You can edit the codebase normally and each server will incorporate your changes.

To see how the mirror emulation works, check out perma_web/mirroring/management/commands/runmirror.py


## Working with Celery

Celery does two things in Perma.cc. It runs the indexing tasks (the things that accept a url and generate an archive) and it runs the scheduled jobs (to gather things nightly like statistics. just like cron might).

In your development environment (if you are not using Vagrant, where the celery service should be running by default), you probably want to start a dev version of Celery like this:

    $ celery -A perma worker --loglevel=info -B

The -B option also starts the Beat server. The Beat server is the thing that runs the scheduled jobs. You don't need the -B if you don't want to run the nightly scheduled jobs.

If you make changes to a Perma.cc Celery task, you'll need to stop and start the Celery server.

If you want to run Celery as a daemon (like you might in prod), there is an example upstart script in services/celery/celery.conf.
This is the script that is used to run the daemon for Vagrant.

Once installed in /etc/init/, you can start and stop Celery as a service. Something like,

    $ sudo stop celery; sudo start celery 

Find more about daemonizing Celery in the [in the Celery docs](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/daemonizing.html#daemonizing).


## Working with Redis

In our production environment we use Redis as a cache for our thumbnail data. If you're working on Perma you likely won't need it, but if you do want to simulate the production environment, reference Redis and Sorl settings the prod settings file.

## Working with RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is the message broker. In Perma.cc's case, it accepts message from Celery, tosses them in a queue, and dolls them out to Celery worker tasks as needed.

If you've installed RabbitMQ through something like MacPorts (sudo port install), you can start RabbitMQ using something like, 

    $ sudo rabbitmq-server -detached

If you don't want to run RabbitMQ as a daemon (like you might in prod), create a something like /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server and place this in it,

	#!/bin/sh
	#
	# rabbitmq-server RabbitMQ broker

	restart_rabbitmq() {
	    stop_rabbitmq
	    start_rabbitmq

	case "$1" in

	        echo -n "Starting $DESC: "
	        start_rabbitmq
	        echo "$NAME."
	        ;;
	    stop)
	        echo -n "Stopping $DESC: "
	        stop_rabbitmq
	        echo "$NAME."
	        ;;
	    status)
	        status_rabbitmq
	        ;;
	    rotate-logs)
	        echo -n "Rotating log files for $DESC: "
	        rotate_logs_rabbitmq
	        ;;
	    force-reload|reload|restart)
	        echo -n "Restarting $DESC: "
	        restart_rabbitmq
	        echo "$NAME."
	        ;;
	    try-restart)
	        echo -n "Restarting $DESC: "
	        restart_running_rabbitmq
	        echo "$NAME."
	        ;;
	    *)
	        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|rotate-logs|restart|condrestart|try-restart|reload|force-reload}" >&2
	        RETVAL=1
	        ;;
	esac

	exit $RETVAL


Now you can start and stop RabbitMQ as a service. Something like,

    $ sudo service rabbitmq-server stop; sudo service rabbitmq-server start;


## ImageMagick and Wand

If you're on OS X you might need to adjust an [environment variable](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.3.8/guide/install.html#install-imagemagick-on-mac)

	export MAGICK_HOME=/opt/local
