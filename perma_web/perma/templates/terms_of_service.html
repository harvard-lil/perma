			<h1>Perma Terms Of Service</h1>
			
			<p><span class="italic bold">Effective Date: September, 23, 2013</span></p>
			<p>Use of the website <a class="bold" href="{% url 'landing' %}">http://perma.cc/</a> (the “Site”) and the content and services provided through the Site is subject to the following terms and conditions.  <span class="bold">By using the Site, you accept and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service, whether or not you register for an account. If you are using the Site on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service for that organization and promising that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms of Service. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to the organization on behalf of which you are using the Site. </span></p>
			
			<p>If any of these Terms of Service is unacceptable to you, do not use the Site.</p>
			
			<p>The Site is operated by President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”) in support of its mission to educate and disseminate knowledge and information.  As used in these Terms of Service, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Harvard Law School Library’s Perma.cc initiative and to Harvard more generally.</p>
			
			<p>Perma.cc helps authors and journals create links for citations in legal and scholarly works.  Through the Site, authors and journals can create links to and direct us to store archival copies of web pages cited in legal and scholarly works, for purposes of scholarship and research.  Some users can “vest” those links and archival copies, allowing longer-term preservation.  Visitors to the Site can access those links and archival copies under certain conditions.  The services provided by us through or in connection with the Site are referred to collectively as the “Service.” </p>
