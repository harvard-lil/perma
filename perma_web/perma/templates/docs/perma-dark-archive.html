		<h4><a href="#">I. What does dark archive mean?</a></h4>
		<p>Perma.cc is a service, currently in beta, that allows users to create citation links that will never break.</p>
		
		<p>When a user creates a Perma.cc link, Perma.cc archives a copy of the referenced content, and generates a link to an unalterable hosted instance of the site.  Regardless of what may happen to the original source, if the link is later published by a journal using the Perma.cc service, the archived version will always be available through the Perma.cc link.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4><a href="#">II. When does something go into the dark archive?</a></h4>
		<p>Readers who click on a Perma.cc link are taken to a page that lets them choose to go to the original site (which may have changed since the link was created) or see the archived copy of the site in its original state.</p>
		
		<br/>
		<h4><a href="#">III. Who has access to dark archived materials?</a></h4>
		<p>Perma.cc is an online preservation service developed by the Harvard Law School Library in conjunction with university law libraries across the country and other organizations in the “forever” business.</p>

		<h4><a href="#">IV. How do I get something that's in the dark archive?</a></h4>
		<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2329161">In a sample of several legal journals</a>, approximately 70% of all links in citations published between 1999 and 2011 no longer point to the same material.  Broken links in journal articles undermine the citation-based system of legal scholarship by obscuring the evidence underlying authors’ ideas.</p>
