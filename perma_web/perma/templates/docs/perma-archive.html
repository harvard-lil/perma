		<h4><div id="formats">Archive Formats</div></h4>
		<p>Perma provides multiple archive formats for each archived web page. You can navigate through the different formats using the tabs at the top of each page. </p>
		
		<br/>
		<pre>Live Page View<div class="highlighted-definition">The cited web page as it currently exists.</div></pre>
		
		<p>In the Live Page View, you’ll see the live, present-day contents of the original source URL. This view, which is not an archive, allows you to check quickly to see if the original page is still live and, if so, you can navigate directly to the live site. </p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/live-page2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma archive page, highlighting the Live page view tab."/>
		
		<p>If the Live Site View reveals a 404 error or the original web page has changed, you can use the tabs to select among available archive formats for the cited web page.</p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/404.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma archive page. Includes a closeup that shows that the Live page view tab will display what the original URL currently displays (in an iframe)."/>
		
		<br/>
		<pre>Screen Cap·ture View<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">An image of the cited webpage as it existed when the Perma Link was created.</span></pre>

				
		<p>If you select the Screen Capture tab, you’ll see a screenshot of the original web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created. If the Perma Link is unvested, you will see a blue Perma icon overlay on the image.</p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screen-capture2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of perma archive page, highlighting the Screen capture tab."/>
		
		<br/>
		<pre>Ar·chived Page View<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">The webpage, rendered in html & css, with accompanying images, that best recreates the view and functionality as it existed when the Perma Link was created.</span></pre>
		
		
		<p>If you select the Archived Page tab, you’ll see an interactive archive of the cited web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created. If the Perma Link is unvested, you will see the blue Perma icon overlay on the archived pages.</p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/archived-page2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of perma archive page, highlighting the Archvied page view tab."/>
		<br/>
		
		<h4><div id="public">Public Archive</div></h4>
		
		<pre>Pub·lic Ar·chive<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">A repository for publicly viewable materials archived using Perma.</span></pre>
		
		<p>Most of the materials archived by Perma users are part of the Public Archive, which means the materials are publicly accessible to anyone who clicks the associated Perma Link or enters the URL for that Perma Link into their browser. </p>
		<br/>
		
		<h4><div id="dark">Dark Archive</div></h4>
		
		<pre>Dark Ar·chive<div class="highlighted-definition">A repository for materials archived using Perma, but which are not publicly viewable.</div></pre>
		
		<p>Some of the materials archived by Perma users become part of the Dark Archive, which means they are preserved but not widely accessible. These materials remain available to the person who created the Perma Link. Once vested, these materials also are available to the Vesting User, Vesting Organization and Registrar responsible for the vesting decision. </p>
		
		<p>Materials may become part of the Dark Archive for different reasons. The person who created or vested a Perma Link may designate it for the Dark Archive. Also, by default, Perma places in the Dark Archive any pages with a “noarchive” metatag or a Perma-specific exclusion in the robots.txt file. Finally, archived materials are placed in the Dark Archive upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice.</p>

		<!--<pre>Mir·rors<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">Our network of servers that each hold the complete perma.cc archives, duplicated to ensure fault-tolerance. </span></pre>
		
		<h4><div id="mirror">Archive Mirroring</div></h4>
		<p>Perma.cc is a service, currently in beta, that allows users to create citation links that will never break.</p>
		
		<p>When a user creates a Perma.cc link, Perma.cc archives a copy of the referenced content, and generates a link to an unalterable hosted instance of the site.  Regardless of what may happen to the original source, if the link is later published by a journal using the Perma.cc service, the archived version will always be available through the Perma.cc link.</p>-->
