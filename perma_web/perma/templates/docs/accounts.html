      <h2 id="accounts" class="body-ah">Accounts</h2>

      <h3 id="individual-accounts" class="body-bh">Individual Accounts</h3>
      <p class="body-text">To preserve web pages with Perma, you need an account. To register for an individual account, please visit our <a href="{% url 'sign_up' %}">signup page</a>.</p>
      <p class="body-text">You don't need an account to view an archived page that someone else preserved.</p>

      <h3 id="registrar-accounts" class="body-bh">Registrar Accounts</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Perma also offers accounts to libraries and other entities who administer the Perma service for the individuals and smaller groups within their communities. We call each of these entities a "registrar." Each registrar decides which individuals and groups are affiliated with it and generally supervises the use of Perma by those affiliates.</p>

      <h3 id="account-affiliations" class="body-bh">Account Affiliations</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Accounts can be affiliated with any number of registrars. Affiliations are like sponsorships. When a registrar chooses to affiliate with an individual or group, those affiliates share in the registrar's usage plan and can preserve web pages in that registrar's name. The registrar can see and manage any preserved records they've made through that affiliation. And the registrar can end the affiliation at any time.</p>

      <h2 id="usage-plans" class="body-ah">Usage Plans</h2>

      <h3 id="free-usage-plans" class="body-bh">Free Usage Plans</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Perma is free for academic use. If you are a member of an academic community (current student, faculty or staff) and your library is a Perma registrar, contact your library to request affiliation. If your library is not yet a Perma registrar, they can learn more and sign up for free using this page: <a href="{% url 'sign_up_libraries' %}">https://perma.cc/libraries</a>.</p>
      <p class="body-text">Perma also is free for use by state and federal courts and their employees, including reporters of decisions, judges, clerks and other court staff. If your court is interested in using Perma, you can use this page to learn more and contact us about signing up: <a href="{% url 'sign_up_courts' %}">https://perma.cc/signup/courts</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="paid-usage-groups" class="body-bh">Paid Usage Plans for Groups</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Law firms, publishers, news organizations and other entities may become registrars through a paid usage plan, which will give them access to Perma's collaboration and administrative tools and allow them to make Perma available to their employees. To learn more about paid plans, please <a href="{% url 'sign_up_firm' %}">contact us</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="paid-usage-individuals" class="body-bh">Paid Usage Plans for Individuals</h3>
      <p class="body-text">For individuals who are not affiliated with Perma registrars, or who want independent access to Perma, we offer paid usage plans. There are two options, based on different types of usage:</p>
      <p class="body-text">Ongoing subscription for users who create Perma Links at a consistent cadence</p>
      <ul class="body-text">
        <li class="tight">10 links per month $10/month</li>
        <li class="tight">100 links per month $25/month</li>
        <li class="tight">500 links per month $100/month</li>
        <li>Uncreated links do not carry over to the next subscription period. Billing occurs on the first of the month, and we prorate the first cycle of your subscription if itâ€™s activated mid-month.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-text">One-time purchase of links that can be used on any timeline</p>
      <ul class="body-text">
        <li class="tight">10 additional links $15</li>
        <li class="tight">100 additional links $30</li>
        <li class="tight">500 additional links $125</li>
