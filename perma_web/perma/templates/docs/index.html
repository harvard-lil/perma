			<h2>Introducing Perma.cc</h2>
			<h3 id="what-is-perma">What is Perma.cc?</h3>
			<p>Perma.cc is a service that helps prevent link rot.</p>
			
			<p>Link rot (and “reference rot”) happens when you cite to an online source that later disappears or changes. It's a big problem, especially for academic scholarship and judicial opinions, which depend heavily on citations to stable sources that readers can access. For example, a <a href="http://perma.cc/48QZ-DT6L">study</a> conducted by researchers at Harvard Law School found that more than 70% of the links in a sample of law journals and 50% of the links in Supreme Court opinions no longer work.</p>
			
			<p>Perma.cc and its <a href="{% url 'about' %}">consortium of participating libraries</a> are working to solve this problem.</p>
			<h3 id="what-does-perma-do">What does Perma.cc do?</h3>
			<p>You tell Perma.cc the web address you want to preserve and cite. Our software goes to that web address, preserves what's there, deposits it into our collection, and gives you a unique URL (e.g. "perma.cc/ABCD-1234") that points to the record in our collection. You then can use that link in your citation so that your readers can get to a stable, accurate record of the source you referenced, even if the original source disappears from the web.</p>
			<h3 id="what-is-vesting">What is vesting?</h3>
			<p>Perma.cc's mission is the very long-term preservation of online <em>sources</em>. To better serve this mission, we've introduced vesting. Vesting is the act of confirming that a given link and the record to which it points is in fact the cited source and thus should be deposited into the permanent collection of participating libraries. Once vested, a link and its associated record become permament. Unvested links eventually expire.</p>
			<p>While anyone can use Perma.cc to create unvested links, only designated users (we call them <em>vesting users</em>) have the authority to vest links. Perma.cc's partner libraries - called "registrars" - decide who gets vesting authority. </p>
			<h3 id="example-perma">Perma.cc example</h3>
			<p>Suppose you're a law professor working on an article and you want to cite to the FBI's <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten">Top Ten Most Wanted List</a>. Because that list changes over time, your citation is going to rot and your future readers won't be able to access your actual source at the original URL. That's bad for you and your readers.</p>
			<p>But if you give Perma.cc the web address - e.g. <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten">http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten</a> - our software will visit the page, make a record of it and give you a unique URL that points to the preserved record - e.g. <a class="perma" href="https://perma.cc/T8U2-994F?type=source">perma.cc/T8U2-994F</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have vesting privileges, you can vest the link yourself. Or, when you submit your article for publication, the publishing journal can vest the link. At that point, the link can be added to your citation, and your future readers will be able to access the intended source no matter what happens to the original web page.</p>
			<p>Please <a href="{% url 'register' %}">sign up</a> and give it try, or read on to learn more.

			<h2>Perma.cc Basics</h2>
			<h3 id="account-holders">Account-holders</h3>
			<p>Perma.cc has three categories of account-holders: (1) registrar users; (2) vesting users; (3) general users. Each category has different authorities and responsibilities.</p>
			<p><em><strong><span id="registrar-users">Registrar users</span></strong></em> are people who work at libraries and other trusted institutions that have become registrars. They have vesting privileges. They help administer Perma.cc, and they decide which other users and organizations receive vesting privileges. For example, the Harvard Law School Library is a registrar. Some members of the Library staff are registrar users. They grant vesting privileges to new journals and faculty, and they help all of the Harvard Law School journals and faculty members who use Perma.cc. </p>
			<p><em><strong><span id="vesting-users">Vesting users</span></strong></em> are people who belong to journals or other organizations that have been granted vesting privileges by libraries. They can vest links on behalf of their organizations, and they can add and remove other vesting users on behalf of their organizations. For example, the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> is a vesting organization. Several of its editors are vesting users. They vest the links cited in published articles, and they decide when to add new vesting users to the Law Review (such as when the new class of editors is selected), or when to remove vesting users from the Law Review (such as when a class of editors graduates).<p>
			<p><em><strong><span id="general-users">General users</span></strong></em> are individuals with Perma.cc accounts, who aren't affiliated with a vesting organization or registrar. General users can create and manage their own links, but they can't vest their links. <p>

		<h3 id="create-account">Creating an account</h3>
			<p>To use Perma.cc to preserve online sources, you'll need to create an account. It's easy. Just <a href="{% url 'register' %}">click here</a> or find the <kbd>Create An Account</kbd> button on the home page:</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_home.png" class="img-resdponsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the landing page."/>
	
			<p>Then enter your email, first and last name. And please read the <a href="{% url 'terms_of_service' %}">terms of service</a>!</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_create_account.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screnshot of the registration page."/>
			
			<!--<p>If your chosen account information is available (not already taken by another user), you will see a confirmation page and receive an email at the account you specified. Please follow the instructions in the email to activate your account. If the system indicates that your email address has already been assigned to another user, it is possible that someone in your institution has already added you as a user.  You can use the password reset option and your email address to claim your account.</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/email-account.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Responsive image"/>
			
			<p>If you are affiliated with a law library, academic law journal, or court system, you may receive an email that an account has been created for you.  Follow the instructions in that email to activate your account, which will be affiliated with your particular institution including the power to vest links if assigned to you.</p>-->
		<h3 id="navigating-account">Navigating your account</h3>
			<p>When you log in to Perma, you’ll see the Perma dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen. From this menu you can navigate to your links, to various user management pages (if you're a registrar user or vesting user), and to our tools and settings pages.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_dropdown.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma dropdown menu."/>
	
			<p>The <em>My Links</em> page gives you quick access to all of the links you've created. If you're a member of a vesting organization or registrar, you'll also see all the links associated with your organization. From this page, you can <a href="#annotating-links">annotate</a> links and <a href="#organizing-links">organize</a> them into folders according to your or your organization's preferences.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_my_links.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page."/>
	
	
		<h3 id="creating-links">Creating links</h3>
	
			<p>To make a Perma Link, just enter the source URL and click the button. Perma will visit the web page at your direction and create a record of the contents of that page.</p>	
			
			<p>The entry box accepts multiple formats, including www and https://.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot-create-link.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page with the URL of a potential archive."/>
			
			<p>Once processing is done, Perma will display a "Success!" message, a thumbnail image of the preserved page and the new Perma Link (such as perma.cc/ABCD-1234). You should review the thumbnail image and click on the new Perma Link to confirm that the new record displays accurately.</p> 
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot-success.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of a Create an Archive page with a newly created archive. Includes the URL and the thumbnail preview."/>
	
			<p class="red">Important Note: At this point, you’ve created a temporary record. It must be vested to become permanent. <a href="#vesting-links">Click here to learn more about vesting.</a></p>
	
			<p>If preservation fails for some reason, Perma.cc will display a "Failure" message and give you the option to upload your own screenshots (.png, .jpg) or PDF documents.</p>
	
		<h3 id="archive-formats">Archive formats</h3>
	
			<p>Perma provides multiple archive formats for each archived web page: (1) live page view, (2) screen capture and (3) archived page. You can navigate through the different formats using the tabs at the top of each page. </p>
	
			<p>In the "live page view," you’ll see the live, present-day contents of the original source URL. This view, which is not an archive, allows you to check quickly to see if the original page is still live and, if so, you can navigate directly to the live site. </p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/live-page2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma archive page, highlighting the Live page view tab."/>
	
			<p>If the live page view reveals a 404 error or the original web page has changed, you can use the tabs to select among available archive formats for the cited web page.</p>
			
			<p>If you select the "screen capture" tab, you’ll see a screenshot of the original web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created.</p>
			
			<p>If you select the "archived page" tab, you’ll see an interactive archive of the cited web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created.</p>
	
		<h3 id="darchive">Dark archive</h3>
	
			<p>Most of the materials archived by Perma users are publicly accessible to anyone who clicks the associated Perma Link or enters the URL for that Perma Link into their browser. </p>
	
			<p>Some of the materials archived by Perma users become part of a dark archive, which means they are preserved but not widely accessible. These materials remain available to the person who created the Perma Link. Once vested, these materials also are available to the vesting user, vesting organization and registrar responsible for the vesting decision. When a reader encounters something in the dark archive, they'll see this screen, which invites them to contact a participating librarian for help acccessing the archived materials:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_darchive.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot a Perma dark archive page."/></p>
	
			<p>Materials may become part of the dark archive for different reasons. The person who created or vested a Perma Link may designate it for the dark archive. Also, by default, Perma places in the dark archive any pages with a “noarchive” metatag or a Perma-specific exclusion in the robots.txt file. Finally, archived materials are placed in the dark archive upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice.</p>
			
		<h3 id="vesting-links">Vesting links</h3>
	
			<p>Each link starts out as unvested and temporary. Perma will maintain these links for at least two years after they're made. Then Perma will give you the option to renew the record for another temporary period, after which it will expire. Unvested links have a large orange banner and stopwatch icon to make it clear to everyone that they are temporary and will expire:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}/img/docs/screenshot_temp_warning.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the temporary link banner."/>
	
			<p>A link must be vested to become permanent. A user with vesting privileges simply needs to visit the link, review the archived material and click the green <kbd>Vest site</kbd> button in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
							
			<p>After clicking "Vest," the user will be prompted to assign the vested link to the appropriate Vesting Organization and folder for that organization. Once vested, a Perma Link cannot be deleted by users.</p>
	
		<h3 id="organizing-links">Organizing links</h3>
	
			<p>You can organize your links into folders. Just select "My links" from the dropdown menu to access your folders. From this view you can add folders, delete folders, rename folders, and drag-and-drop links into the right folders. If you're a <a href="#registrar-users">registrar user</a> or <a href="#vesting-users">vesting user</a>, you'll have access to all the folders for your organization:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_my_links.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page."/>
	
			<p>Note that once a link is vested, it can't be moved from vesting organization's folders to another.</p>
	
		<h3 id="annotating-links">Annotating links</h3>
	
			<p>You can annotate any link accessible to you. Just select "My links" from the dropdown menu, click on the right folder, and then click the "More" button on the item you want to annotate. The item will expand to display more details about the link. From this view you can edit the title, add notes, move the link to another folder and view other metadata about the link:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}/img/docs/screenshot_annotate.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the link metadata view."/>
	
		<h3 id="using-links">Using links</h3>
	
			<p>How you use the links in citations is really up to you. We like it when journals include the original citation and the Perma Link, like this:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}/img/examples/HLR_2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="An example from the Harvard Law Review" />
	
			<p>But that's not the only way to do it. The key is to make it easy for your readers to find the source when the original link rots.</p>

			<h2>For Libraries and Other Registrars</h2>
			
			<h3 id="becoming-registrar">Becoming a registrar</h3>
			<p>Any academic library can become a registrar for free. Just email us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> and tell us who you are, what kinds of users and usage you intend to support and who your contact person is. We'll get back to with some very basic setup instructions.</p>
			<p>In general, registrar status is reserved for libraries and other trusted insitutions that help administer Perma.cc and ensure its appropriate use. If you're not with an academic library but still would like to be a registrar, please email us and tell us who you are, why you want to join Perma as registrar and what types of users and organizations you would expect to support as a registrar.</p>  
			
			<h3 id="libraries-authority">Authority and responsibilities</h3>
			<p>Registrars can vest links, confer (and withdraw) vesting authority and create new vesting organizations. Typically this means acting as the hub of a network of vesting organizations and their users. As a registrar, you'll help train and support Perma.cc users within your network. You'll also be responsible for ensuring that those in your network with vesting authority do not abuse that authority. Every link vested by anyone within your network becomes automatically associated with you, as the relevant registrar, so it's important that you exercise judgment in approving vesting organizations. If you like, you can adopt policies and best practices for Perma.cc usage by those in your network.</p>
			
			<h3 id="creating-vesting-orgs">Creating new vesting orgs</h3>
			<p>Creating new vesting organizations is easy. Just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting organizations." Click "add new" to trigger the new vesting organization form, fill out the appropriate details and press the <kbd>Create new vesting organization</kbd> button:<p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}/img/docs/screenshot_new_vesting_orgs.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Screenshot of manage users screen." />
			
			<h3 id="placing-users-with-vesting-orgs">Assigning users to vesting orgs</h3>
			<p>Once you've created a vesting org, you'll want to assign at least one vesting user to that vesting org. Just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting users." Click "add new" to trigger the new vesting user form and enter the person's email. If she already has a Perma.cc account, we'll note that and invite you to assign that user to a vesting org. If she doesn't have a Perma.cc account, we'll ask you for the person's name and invite you to assign her to a vesting org. Once you submit, we'll send that person a verification email so she can get up and running.</p>
			<p>Vesting users may be associated with more than one vesting org. To assign a vesting user to another vesting org, click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting users." Then click "add new," enter the user's email address and select the appropriate vesting org.</p>
			<p>To remove a vesting user from a vesting org, click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting users." Find the person's name and click "edit/remove," which will take you to an edit screen. From that screen you can remove the user from the desired vesting orgs.</p> 
			
			<h3 id="supporting-journals-and-faculty">Supporting journals and faculty</h3>
			<p>Each library is free to develop its own Perma.cc policies and practices. As a registrar, you can support as many or as few users associated with your institution as you like. To get you started, here are a few approaches you might adopt for helping journals and faculty use Perma.cc.</p>
			<p>For journals, many libraries set up each journal up as a vesting org and then let the journal manage its own internal usage. Many libraries help journals by training new members and serving as a resource for questions about how to use Perma.cc.</p>
			<p>For faculty, many libraries create separate vesting orgs for each faculty member. These faculty vesting orgs can include the faculty member herself, as well as any secretaries, research assistants or interns. Remember that if you combine faculty into a single vesting org, they will be able to observe - and potentially move - each other's links.</p>

			<h2>For Journals, Courts, and Other Vesting Organizations</h2>
			
			<h3 id="becoming-vesting-org">Becoming a vesting org</h3>
			<p>If you're with an academic institution, simply contact your library and ask if it is a Perma.cc registrar. If your library isn't yet a registrar, ask them to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> about joining Perma.cc as a registrar. If you're part of a court or other governmental entity, please contact us directly and we'll help you get started.</p>  
			
			<h3 id="journals-authority">Authority and responsibilities</h3>
			<p>Vesting orgs can vest links and confer (and withdraw) vesting authority. Typically a vesting org is a collection of vesting users working together on a journal, for a faculty member or for a court. A vesting org is responsible for ensuring that its vesting users do not abuse their vesting authority. Every link vested by anyone within your vesting org becomes automatically associated with the vesting org, so it's important that you exercise judgment about who can be a vesting user and what vesting activities are appropriate. If you like, you can adopt policies and best practices for Perma.cc usage by those in your organization.<p>
			<p>Within a vesting org, every vesting user has access to all of the links vested on behalf of the org. This lets vesting org members work collaboratively and to organize links across the organization. It also means every member's vesting activities are visible to all the other members of the vesting org.</p> 
			
			<h3 id="adding-vesting-users">Adding and removing vesting users</h3>
			<p>Every vesting user within a vesting org has the ability to add or remove vesting users on behalf of the organization. Each organization should decide for itself, in consultation with its registrar, how it wants to manage the addition and removal of vesting users.</p>
			<p>To add new vesting users, just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting users." Click "add new" to trigger the vesting user form, enter the email address of the person you want to add, and click the "add" button.</p>
			<p>To remove vesting users from your vesting org, just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu, find the person's name in your list of vesting users, and click "edit/remove," which will take you to an edit screen. From that screen you can remove the user from your vesting org.<p>
