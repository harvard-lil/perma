		<p>All web pages you archive through Perma will begin as unvested, temporary archives. Perma will maintain these archives and their associated Perma Links for at least two years following creation. At the end of that temporary period, Perma will give you the option to renew the archived web page for another temporary period, after which the Perma Link may expire.</p>
		
		<p>To become permanent, however, a Perma Link must be vested by someone with vesting authority. Perma’s focus at this stage is to provide lasting links to online materials cited in academic scholarship, judicial opinions and educational materials. Vesting signifies that an individual affiliated with a journal, court or library has confirmed that the archived materials support these goals and should be preserved as a part of the permanent collection of participating libraries.</p>
		
		<p>To vest a Perma Link, a user with vesting privileges (a “Vesting User”) simply needs to visit the Perma Link URL, review the archived material and click the “Vest” button in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>

		<pre class="inset2">Vest·ing Or·gan·i·za·tion<div class="highlighted-definition">An entity (such as a law journal or court) that is responsible for the Vesting Users it creates and the Perma Links that are vested by those Vesting Users. </div></pre>
		
		<pre class="inset1">Vest·ing Us·er<div class="highlighted-definition">A Perma user who is affiliated with one or more Vesting Organizations and has the authority to vest Perma Links on behalf of those organizations.</div></pre>
		
		<p>To ensure that vesting occurs only when warranted, Perma restricts vesting privileges to certain users - called “Vesting Users.” Each Vesting User is affiliated with a Vesting Organization, each of which is affiliated, in turn, with a Registrar. Whenever a Perma Link is vested, it is associated not only with the user who created it, but also with the Vesting User,  the Vesting Organization and the Registrar responsible for making it part of the permanent collection of participating libraries.</p>
		
		<p>We leave it to Registrars and Vesting Organization to manage permissions for their organizations and to adopt policies for adding new Vesting Organizations and authorizing new Vesting Users.</p>
		
		<p>If you are affiliated with a law library, law journal, or court system <a href="{% url 'about' %}">click here</a> to see if your institution is a perma.cc partner. If so, you can contact your institution directly for information about vesting privileges. If you do not see your institution listed, then please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> and we’ll see if we can help.</a>
