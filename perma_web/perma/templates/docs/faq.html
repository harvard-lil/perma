			 	<div class="faq-answer">
			 		<p>Perma.cc is developed and maintained by the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> at the Harvard Law School Library. Perma.cc is administered by a <a href="{% url 'about' %}#partners">consortium</a> of libraries, with each library assisting its local journals and faculty users.

				  <div class="docs-bh" data-href="what-is">Who can use Perma.cc?</div>
				  <div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Anyone can sign up for a free Perma.cc <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#create-account">account</a>, which you can use to preserve links temporarily. To create permanent links, you have to be a <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#vesting-users">vesting user</a>.</p>

				  <div class="docs-bh" data-href="forever">How long will you keep my Perma.cc Links?</div>
				  <div class="faq-answer">
	                <p>Unvested links will be kept for at least two years following creation. At the end of that temporary period, we'll give you the option to renew the archived web page for another temporary period, after which the Perma Link will expire.</p>
	                <p>Vested links will be preserved as a part of the permanent collection of participating libraries. While we can't guarantee that links will be preserved forever, we are hosted by university libraries that have endured for centuries, and we are planning to be around for the long term. If we ever <i>do</i> need to shut down, we have laid out a detailed <a href="{% url 'contingency_plan' %}">contingency plan</a> for preserving existing data.</p>
	                <p>For more detailed information about vesting, please visit our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#vesting-links">user guide</a>.</p>

				  	<p>If you're affiliated with an academic institution, please contact your library.

				  	<p>If you're affiliated with a court, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> for assistance.</a>
				  	<p>Vesting currently is limited to those affiliated with academic institutions or courts, but we are exploring ways to expand access.

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="library-partner">What is a Perma.cc partner library?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Perma.cc is administered by a community of partner libraries, also called "registrars." Each of these libraries is responsible for helping its affiliated journals and scholars use Perma.cc. Each of these libraries has special authority and oversight privileges, including the ability to create and remove vesting organizations and to monitor Perma.cc usage by associated users.</p>
					<p>To learn more about the role of libraries in Perma.cc, check out our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#libraries-and-registrars">user guide</a>.</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="become-partner">Can my library become a Perma.cc partner library?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Any academic library can become a Perma.cc partner library. If you're interested, email us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a>. Please tell us who you are, what kinds of users and usage you intend to support and who your contact person is. We'll get back to with some very basic setup instructions.</p>
					<p>Non-academic libraries should <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">contact us</a> to learn more about the options currently available for your patrons and staff.</p> 
				</div>
			
				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="sponsor-journal">What are the fees to become a Perma.cc registrar?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Becoming a registrar is free for academic libraries and courts.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="registrar-responsibilities">What are the responsibilities of a Perma.cc registrar?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Your main responsibility is help the journals and scholars within your community use Perma.cc. This means setting up vesting organizations, helping to train new users and acting as a resource for those at your institution who want to use Perma.cc.</p>
					<p>Check out our user guide for more information on the <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#libraries-authority">authority and responsibilities</a> of registrars.</p>

			  <h2 class="docs-ah" id="journals">Academic journals</h2>

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="who-vesting-users">Which journal members should be vesting users?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals grant vesting privileges to all journal members. Some grant vesting privileges only to senior editorial staff.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="upon-graduation">What happens when journal members graduate?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals remove vesting users upon graduation. Others don't. Bear in mind that if you keep vesting users on after graduation, any links they vest will be associated with your journal's vesting organization and visible to all of the vesting users for your organization. Likewise, they will be able to access (and potentially modify) any links others on your journal decide to vest.</p>
					<p>Review our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#adding-vesting-users">user guide</a> to learn more about adding and removing vesting users.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="multiple-vesting-orgs">Can vesting users be affiliated with multiple journals?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Yes. Check out the <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#placing-users-with-vesting-orgs">user guide</a> for more information about assigning vesting users to multiple vesting orgs.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="docs-bh" data-href="bluebook">What does the Bluebook say about using Perma.cc?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Rule 18.2.1(d) in the 20th Edition of <a href="https://www.legalbluebook.com/">The Bluebook</a> says: "Archiving of Internet sources is encouraged, but only when a reliable archival tool is available.  For citations to Internet sources, append the archive URL to the full citation in brackets."</p>
					<p>The Bluebook uses Perma.cc as an example of a reliable archival tool.</p>

		  		</p>
		  	</div>

		  	<div class="docs-bh" data-href="perma-code">Is Perma.cc open source?</div>
		  	<div class="faq-answer">

		  	<div class="docs-bh" data-href="no-indexing">Are Perma.cc archives available in search engines?</div>
		  	<div class="faq-answer">
		  		<p>We don't make archived pages available to search engines.</p>
		  	</div>

			<div class="docs-bh" data-href="robots-text">Can I prevent Perma.cc from publicly displaying archives of pages from my site?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				 <p>
                     It's important to note that Perma.cc does not crawl your site like a search engine might,
                     and it does not make its archives available in search engines. It simply saves a copy of a single page at the direction of a user, as though the user visited your page and used the "Save as ..." function of their browser.
                 </p>
				 <p>
                     If you don't want Perma.cc to make archives of your site available online to future readers of scholarly work, we're happy to respect your wishes.
                 </p>
				 <p>
                     To prevent online archives for entire sections of your site,
                     use a configuration in your robots.txt file like the one below:
                 </p>
				 <p class="code">
				 	 User-agent: Perma<br/>
					 Disallow: /private-stuff/
				 </p>
				 <p>
                     To prevent online archives for a single page, use one of the following meta tags:
                 </p>
				 <p class="code">
					 &lt;meta name="Perma" content="noarchive" /&gt;
					 &lt;meta name="robots" content="noarchive" /&gt;
				 </p>
				 <p>
                     With either or both of these rules in place, Perma.cc will still allow the user to store
                     the requested page in library archives, but will not display it at the perma.cc website.
                 </p>
