      <div class="faq-answer">

While we can't guarantee that these records will be preserved forever, we are hosted by university libraries that have endured for centuries, and we are planning to be around for the long term.

Each of these libraries is responsible for helping its affiliated journals and scholars use Perma.cc. Each of these libraries has special authority and oversight privileges, including the ability to create and remove archiving organizations and to monitor Perma.cc usage by associated users.</p>

      <h2 class="body-ah" id="billing">Subscriptions and Billing</h2>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Who qualifies for a free account?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">For individuals, anyone who is currently affiliated with a registrar organization can request a free account via their Perma administrator. Otherwise, users can access Perma via a paid subscription.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">When will you charge my credit card?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">We bill on the first of each month for the tier that you have most recently requested. You’ll be able to make up to that number of links during that month.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">What happens if I join or upgrade in the middle of the month?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">If you subscribe or upgrade partway through the month, we'll immediately increase your link limit to that of your new subscription minus the links you’ve already used, and immediately bill you a prorated amount based on how much of the month is left. At the beginning of the next month, we will bill you at the new rate.
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">How does prorating work?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
      <h4>Here's an example for new users:</h4>
       <p class="body-text">If you subscribe on the first day of the month, we charge you $10 since you will have an account for the entire coming month. On the first of the next month, you will be rebilled at the $10/mo rate. You will have a full 10 links available.</p>
       <p class="body-text">If you subscribe halfway through the month, we'll charge you half, or $5, since you would have an account for half the month. You will have a full 10 links available. On the first of the next month, you will be rebilled at the $10/mo rate.</p>
      <h4> Here's an example for current users:</h4>
       <p class="body-text">You have a 10 link, $10/mo account and want to upgrade to a 20 link, $20/mo account. You have already used 3 links, so you have 7 left in your account. If you purchase the upgrade on the first day of the month, the upgrade will cost $10, the full amount, since you will have an upgraded account for the entire coming month. Since your new account limits afford you 10 more links, you will now have 17 links for the rest of the month. On the first of the next month, you will be rebilled at the $20/mo rate, and have a full 20 links available.</p>
       <p class="body-text">If you purchase the upgrade halfway through the month, the upgrade will cost $5, or half of the full amount, since you would have an upgraded account for half the month. Since your new account limits afford you 10 more links, you will now have 17 links for the rest of the month. On the first of the next month, you will be rebilled at the $20/mo rate.</p>

      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">What about downgrading?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">If you request a downgrade, it will go into effect on the first of the following month. Your link limit won’t immediately go down, and when the next billing cycle comes around you’ll be charged the lower rate and your account will have a lower link limit.
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Will I lose links I've already made if I cancel or downgrade my subscription?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Nope. After 24 hours all Perma Links are added to our permanent collection and will be accessible and controllable by you. The only thing a change in your subscription would affect is now many <i>new</i> Perma Links you can create.
      </div>

      <h2 class="body-ah" id="journals">Academic journals</h2>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Which journal members should be affiliated users?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals affiliate all journal members with the organization. Some do so only for senior editorial staff.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">What happens when journal members graduate?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals remove affiliated users upon graduation. Others don't. Bear in mind that if you keep affiliated users on after graduation, any links they create will be associated with your journal's organization and visible to all of the users for your organization. Likewise, they will be able to access (and potentially modify) any links others on your journal create.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Review our <a href="{% url 'docs_accounts' %}">user guide</a> to learn more about adding and removing users.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Can users be affiliated with multiple organizations?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Yes.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">What does the Bluebook say about using Perma.cc?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Rule 18.2.1(d) in the 20th Edition of <a href="https://www.legalbluebook.com/">The Bluebook</a> says: "Archiving of Internet sources is encouraged, but only when a reliable archival tool is available.  For citations to Internet sources, append the archive URL to the full citation in brackets."</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Bluebook uses Perma.cc as an example of a reliable archival tool.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="body-ah" id="technical">Technical</h2>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Which web browsers does Perma.cc support?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Perma.cc works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE10+.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Is Perma.cc open source?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Why yes, it is. The Perma.cc code is <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma">available on Github</a> and dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. Contributions are most welcome.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Does Perma.cc have an API?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Why yes, we do. It's still in its infancy, but if you're interested in learning more please check our <a href="{% url 'dev_docs' %}">developer guide</a> for the details.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Are Perma.cc archives available in search engines?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">We don't make archived pages available to search engines.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">Does Perma.cc preserve embedded links (sometimes also called "deep links" or "secondary links")?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">No. Perma.cc preserves only the targeted page. It does not drill down to capture pages that are linked on the targeted page. So for example, if you use Perma.cc to preserve a page that has 10 links on it, you would preserve that page but not the pages available at the 10 links.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh">How do I view a downloaded archive?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Perma archives are downloadable and can be viewed using tools that can replay WARC files like <a href="https://replayweb.page/">ReplayWeb.page</a></p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" id="noarchive">Can I prevent Perma.cc from publicly displaying archives of pages from my site?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">
          It's important to note that Perma.cc does not crawl your site like a search engine might,
          and it does not make its archives available in search engines. It simply saves a copy of a single page at the direction of a user, as though the user visited your page and used the "Save as ..." function of their browser.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          If you don't want Perma.cc to make archives of your site available online to future readers of scholarly work, we're happy to respect your wishes. Please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}?subject=%20Please%20Make%20My%20Site%20Private">contact us</a>. Perma.cc will still allow the user to store
          the requested page in library archives, but will not display it at the perma.cc website.
