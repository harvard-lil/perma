      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="library-partner">What is a Perma.cc partner library?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Perma.cc is administered by a community of partner libraries, also called "registrars." Each of these libraries is responsible for helping its affiliated journals and scholars use Perma.cc. Each of these libraries has special authority and oversight privileges, including the ability to create and remove archiving organizations and to monitor Perma.cc usage by associated users.</p>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="who-users">Which journal members should be affiliated users?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals affiliate all journal members with the organization. Some do so only for senior editorial staff.</p>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="upon-graduation">What happens when journal members graduate?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals remove affiliated users upon graduation. Others don't. Bear in mind that if you keep affiliated users on after graduation, any links they create will be associated with your journal's organization and visible to all of the users for your organization. Likewise, they will be able to access (and potentially modify) any links others on your journal create.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Review our <a href="{% url 'docs_organizations' %}">user guide</a> to learn more about adding and removing users.</p>

For citations to Internet sources, append the archive URL to the full citation in brackets."</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Bluebook uses Perma.cc as an example of a reliable archival tool.</p>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="perma-code">Is Perma.cc open source?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">

      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="perma-api">Does Perma.cc have an API?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">
          Why yes, we do. It's still in its infancy, but if you're interested in learning more please check our <a href="{% url 'dev_docs' %}">developer guide</a> for the details.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="no-indexing">Are Perma.cc archives available in search engines?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">We don't make archived pages available to search engines.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="deep-links">Does Perma.cc preserve embedded links (sometimes also called "deep links" or "secondary links")?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">No. Perma.cc preserves only the targeted page. It does not drill down to capture pages that are linked on the targeted page. So for example, if you use Perma.cc to preserve a page that has 10 links on it, you would preserve that page but not the pages available at the 10 links.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="warc-replay">How do I view a downloaded archive?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">Perma archives are downloadable and can be viewed using tool that can replay WARC files like <a href="https://github.com/webrecorder/webrecorderplayer-electron/releases/latest">Rhizome's fantastic Webrecorder Player</a></p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="body-bh" data-href="robots-text">Can I prevent Perma.cc from publicly displaying archives of pages from my site?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p class="body-text">
          It's important to note that Perma.cc does not crawl your site like a search engine might,
          and it does not make its archives available in search engines. It simply saves a copy of a single page at the direction of a user, as though the user visited your page and used the "Save as ..." function of their browser.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          If you don't want Perma.cc to make archives of your site available online to future readers of scholarly work, we're happy to respect your wishes.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          To prevent online archives for entire sections of your site,
          use a configuration in your robots.txt file like the one below:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <p class="body-text">User-agent: Perma</p>
          <p class="body-text">Disallow: /private-stuff/</p>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text">
          To prevent online archives for a single page, use one of the following meta tags:
         </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <p class="body-text">&lt;meta name="Perma" content="noarchive"&gt;</p>
          <p class="body-text">&lt;meta name="robots" content="noarchive"&gt;</p>
        </div>
        <p class="body-text">
          With either or both of these rules in place, Perma.cc will still allow the user to store
          the requested page in library archives, but will not display it at the perma.cc website.
