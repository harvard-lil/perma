			 	<div class="question" data-href="who-is">Who runs Perma.cc?</div>
			 	<div class="answer">
			 		<p>Perma.cc is developed and maintained by the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a> at the Harvard Law School Library. Perma.cc is administered by a <a href="{% url 'about' %}#partners">consortium</a> of libraries, with each library assisting its local journals and faculty users. 
			 		</p>
			 	</div>	

				  <div class="question" data-href="what-is">Who can use Perma.cc?</div>
				  <div class="answer">
					<p>Anyone can sign up for a free Perma.cc <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#create-account">account</a>, which you can use to preserve links temporarily. To create permanent links, you have to be a <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#vesting-users">vesting user</a>.</p>
				  </div>
						 		
				  <div class="question" data-href="forever">How long will you keep my Perma.cc Links?</div>
				  <div class="answer">
	                <p>Unvested links will be kept for at least two years following creation. At the end of that temporary period, we'll give you the option to renew the archived web page for another temporary period, after which the Perma Link will expire.</p>
	                <p>Vested links will be preserved as a part of the permanent collection of participating libraries. While we can't guarantee that links will be preserved forever, we are hosted by university libraries that have endured for centuries, and we are planning to be around for the long term. If we ever <i>do</i> need to shut down, we have laid out a detailed <a href="{% url 'contingency_plan' %}">contingency plan</a> for preserving existing data.</p>
	                <p>For more detailed information about vesting, please visit our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#vesting-links">user guide</a>.</p>
	              </div>
				
				  <div class="question" data-href="delete-links">Can I delete a Perma.cc Link?</div>
				  <div class="answer">

				  <div class="question" data-href="get-vesting-privileges">How do I get vesting privileges?</div>
				  <div class="answer">
				  	<p>If you are affiliated with an academic institution, please contact your library. If your library is already a Perma.cc partner (check the <a href="{% url 'about' %}">partner list</a>), then they will be able to help you directly. If your library is not yet a Perma.cc partner and is interested in joining, please ask them to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a>, and we'll set them up as a <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#libraries-and-registrars">registrar</a>.</p>
				  	<p>If you are affiliated with a court, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> for assistance.</a>
				  	<p>Vesting currently is limited to those affiliated with academic institutions or courts, but we are exploring ways to expand access. If you're interested in vesting but aren't affiliated with an academic institution or court, please join our <a href="http://eepurl.com/boOdBj">interest list</a> to stay informed.</p>

			  <h4><div id="librarian">Libraries</div></h4>
				<div class="question" data-href="library-partner">What is a Perma.cc partner library?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Perma.cc is administered by a community of partner libraries, also called "registrars." Each of these libraries is responsible for helping its affiliated journals and scholars use Perma.cc. Each of these libraries has special authority and oversight privileges, including the ability to create and remove vesting organizations and to monitor Perma.cc usage by associated users.</p>
					<p>To learn more about the role of libraries in Perma.cc, check out our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#libraries-and-registrars">user guide</a>.</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="question" data-href="become-partner">Can my library become a Perma.cc partner library?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Any academic library can become a Perma.cc partner library. If you're interested, email us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a>. Please tell us who you are, what kinds of users and usage you intend to support and who your contact person is. We'll get back to with some very basic setup instructions.</p>
					<p>Non-academic libraries should <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">contact us</a> to learn more about the options currently available for your patrons and staff.</p> 
				</div>
			
				<div class="question" data-href="sponsor-journal">What are the fees to become a Perma.cc partner library or registrar?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Nothing.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="question" data-href="registrar-responsibilities">What are the responsibilities of a Perma.cc registrar?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Your main responsibility is help the journals and scholars within your community use Perma.cc. This means setting up vesting organizations, helping to train new users and acting as a resource for those at your institution who want to use Perma.cc.</p>
					<p>Check out our user guide for more information on the <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#libraries-authority">authority and responsibilities</a> of registrars.</p> 
				</div>

			<h4><div id="journals">Academic journals</div></h4>

				<div class="question" data-href="who-vesting-users">Which journal members should be vesting users?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals grant vesting privileges to all journal members. Some grant vesting privileges only to senior editorial staff.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question" data-href="upon-graduation">What happens when journal members graduate?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>That's up to you to decide, in consultation with your registrar. Different journals do it differently. Some journals remove vesting users upon graduation. Others don't. Bear in mind that if you keep vesting users on after graduation, any links they vest will be associated with your journal's vesting organization and visible to all of the vesting users for your organization. Likewise, they will be able to access (and potentially modify) any links others on your journal decide to vest.</p>
					<p>Review our <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#adding-vesting-users">user guide</a> to learn more about adding and removing vesting users.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question" data-href="multiple-vesting-orgs">Can vesting users be affiliated with multiple journals?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Yes. Check out the <a href="{% url 'docs' %}#placing-users-with-vesting-orgs">user guide</a> for more information about assigning vesting users to multiple vesting orgs.</p>

				<div class="question" data-href="journal-sign-up">How can I sign my journal up to use Perma.cc?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>If your journal would like to become a Vesting Organization, simply email <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a>, and we will connect you with a Registrar library (traditionally the library associated with your institution). The Registrar library will add your journal as a Vesting Organization and create at least one Vesting User account, which will enable you to create the accounts your staff will need to vest Perma.cc Links.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question" data-href="how-to-vest">How do I vest a Perma.cc link?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>To vest a Perma.cc link, a user with vesting privileges (a &quot;Vesting User&quot;) simply needs to the visit the Perma Link URL, review the archived material and click the &quot;Vest&quot; button in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
					<p>For more information, visit: <a hrer="http://perma.cc/docs/perma-link-vesting">http://perma.cc/docs/perma-link-vesting</a>.</p>

				</div>
				
				<div class="question" data-href="article-without-links">What if an author submits an article without Perma.cc links?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>All Vesting Users will have the capability to both create and vest Perma.cc links. Thus, Vesting Users can create Perma.cc Links for cited URLs as part of the subciting process.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="question" data-href="citation">How should I include the Perma.cc link in a citation?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Each journal has the ability to formulate its own standard. However, we recommend using a citation format that incorporates the Perma.cc Link URL in brackets after the original URL.</p>
					<p>For example: "Title of Online Source, Author, http://www.example.com/the-original-source-URL.html[http://perma.cc/ABCD-1234]."</p>

			  	<div class="question" data-href="no-indexing">Are Perma.cc archives available in search engines?</div>
			  	<div class="answer">
			  		<p>We don't make archived pages available to search engines.</p>
			  	</div>

				<div class="question" data-href="robots-text">Can I prevent Perma.cc from publicly displaying archives of pages from my site?</div>
				<div class="answer">
					 <p>
	                     It's important to note that Perma.cc does not crawl your site like a search engine might,
	                     and it does not make its archives available in search engines. It simply saves a copy of a single page at the direction of a user, as though the user visited your page and used the "Save as ..." function of their browser.
	                 </p>
					 <p>
	                     If you don't want Perma.cc to make archives of your site available online to future readers of scholarly work, we're happy to respect your wishes.
	                 </p>
					 <p>
	                     To prevent online archives for entire sections of your site,
	                     use a configuration in your robots.txt file like the one below:
	                 </p>
					 <p class="code">
					 	 User-agent: Perma<br/>
						 Disallow: /private-stuff/
					 </p>
					 <p>
	                     To prevent online archives for a single page, use one of the following meta tags:
	                 </p>
					 <p class="code">
						 &lt;meta name="Perma" content="noarchive" /&gt;
						 &lt;meta name="robots" content="noarchive" /&gt;
					 </p>
					 <p>
	                     With either or both of these rules in place, Perma.cc will still allow the user to store
	                     the requested page in library archives, but will not display it at the perma.cc website.
	                 </p>
