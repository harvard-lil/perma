			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the web site <a href="http://perma.cc">http://perma.cc</a> (the “Site”) and the Perma.cc service (the “Service”). The Site is operated by President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”).  As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Harvard Law School Library’s Perma.cc initiative and to Harvard more generally. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected both from users who register to use the Service and from users who view the Site and use the Service without registering.  By using the Site or Service, you are consenting to our collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<h2>Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy</h2>
			
			<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.</p>
			
			<h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
			<p>If you visit our Site to browse, we will collect and store the domain name and host from which you accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser software and operating system, the date and time you access the Site and the Internet address of any web site from which you linked directly to our Site or to which you link after visiting our Site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our Site, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the Site and to help us make the Service more useful. For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties.</p>
			
			<p>To make full use of our Service, you may need to complete our registration process and create an account. We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this registration process, including your user ID and password. We collect and store information about when you create the account and when you log in.  If you engage in a transaction while logged on to the Site, then we collect and store information about the transaction.  If you send us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.</p>
			
			<p>We use information we collect from you to provide and improve the Service.  This may include building features that we hope will make the Service more attractive and easier for you and others to use.  We also may use User Information to generate data and reports about usage of the Site and Service; to support the functioning and security of the Service and our network and systems; to protect our rights, property, or safety or those of others; for research; and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
		
			<p>We may share User Information with third parties in order to provide and improve the Service.  For example, we may contract with third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance of the Site, and may provide them User Information in that connection.  We may also provide User Information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; investigate compliance with or enforce our Terms of Service; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, illegal activity, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.  The information we provide or share for these purposes may include Personally Identifiable Information.  In addition, we may share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the Site and use of the Service, such as demographics and statistical information, for research and other purposes.</p>
			
			<h2>If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information</h2>
			<p>If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you may opt out by not using the Service or the part of the Service that provides us with such User Information. For example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then you may choose not to become a registered User. You will not be entitled to the benefits of registration, but you are still free to browse the Site and to visit the parts of the Site accessible to non-registrants.</p>
			
			<h2>Local Storage</h2>
			<p>The use of “local storage” permits our Site to send information to your browser for storage on your hard drive. This feature can make your use of our Site easier by saving certain aspects about your status and preferences upon visits to our Site. For example, if you create a Perma.cc link without being logged in to a Perma.cc account, we use local storage to save the page’s title and related metadata.</p>
			
			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>The Site will attempt to store a small piece of data known as a “cookie” on your computer.  The cookies are refreshed every time you enter the Site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent. We use cookies in some instances, to associate you with your User Information. For example, through the use of cookies you may log in automatically and thereby save you time. Rejection of cookies can interfere with your ability to log in and use certain parts of the Service.</p>
			
			<h2>Control of Your Password</h2>
			<p>Except as specifically permitted by this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, you may not disclose your Perma.cc password to any third parties nor share it with any third-parties. If you lose control of your Perma.cc password you may lose control over your Personally Identifiable Information, and you will be responsible for any legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password or, if we provided your password, notify us so that we may issue you a new password.</p>
			
			<h2>Underage Users</h2>
			<p>Use of the service is limited to users 18 years of age and older. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our records.</p>
			
			<h2>Third Parties</h2>
			<p>TThis Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User Information collected by us in connection with the Perma.cc Service. If you disclose information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other web sites.  When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that web site. We encourage you to be aware when you are leaving our Site and to review any applicable privacy policies before you disclose your personal information to third parties.
			We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided by other users or third parties that is made available through our Site. Such information may contain errors, intentional or otherwise, or may be offensive, inappropriate or inaccurate, and in some cases may be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.</p>
