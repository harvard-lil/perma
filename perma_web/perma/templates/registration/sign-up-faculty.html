      <h3 class="body-bh">Free and easy to use</h3>
      <p class="body-text">For faculty associated with a registrar library, Perma.cc is free. It is easy to use, and you can authorize others, such as assistants and researchers, to preserve sources on your behalf.<p class="body-text">

      <h3 class="body-bh">Bluebook compliant</h3>
      <p class="body-text">The Bluebook now encourages archiving online sources when a reliable service such as Perma.cc is available.<p class="body-text">

      <h3 class="body-bh">Contact your library for a journal account</h3>
      <p class="body-text">If your library is already registered with us, contact them for setup. If not, invite your library to visit our <a href="{% url 'libraries' %}">library resource page</a> to request membership, and weâ€™ll help them get started.<p class="body-text">

      <h3 class="body-bh">Try it now</h3>
      <p class="body-text">Users not associated with a registrar library must <a href="{% url 'sign_up' %}">sign up for a paid subscription.</a> New users can create 10 Perma Links for free to try out the service. Create an account now to start your free trial. Your library will be able to upgrade your individual account at a later date.<p class="body-text">
